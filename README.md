# Overview of Project
The idea behind this project was to equip Steven and his family with the best information available for their venture into investing in the energy industry.
# Results
2017 was a much better year for returns on energy stocks than 2018. In fact, out of the 12 stocks we looked into, 11 had positive returns in 2017. Whereas only two did in 2018. Refactoring the code made it more efficient to use, because there was no need for nested for loops. Instead, the refactored code was using the tickerIndex variable to refer back to the ticker when necessary.
# Summary
1. The advantages of refactoring code are that you hone your skills. You find redundancies and eliminate them in order to speed up the process. And you do so by following the process to a more logical conclusion, thereby creating subroutines that require less time to process. The disadvantages would be that you may end up spending more time refactoring the code than is actually saved in the long run. You have to account for that balance to ensure it's worth doing in the first place.
2. Taking into account the pros and cons, I don't believe the time spent refactoring this code was worth it. The difference was negligible in regards to how quickly it processed. As an exercise it was very valuable, but in practice, I see no reason to have needed to refactor this code.
